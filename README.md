# DS_Project
The motivation behind this project was identifying the general trend behind the multiple crimes occurred in the NYC area, and shed some light on what can be done to address these issues.

## Data
All of the data used in this project are opensource. The data cleanup is performed using R and Python (to process through multiple data on multiple threads, python was preferred for further cleanup) . The data analysis is later performed on R programming again.
